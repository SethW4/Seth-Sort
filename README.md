An abysmally slow sorting algorithm

The goal of modern sorting algorithms is to shorten their runtime complexity. 

That's boring. My goal here is to undo decades of work with the ultimate sorting algorithm of all time. My goal is at least O(n^n). 

Aka it's 12:24 am, I'm at a hackathon, my work is all but done, and I'm kinda delirious.
